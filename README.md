# Chapter Logos

Several chapters have designed their own logos and we are trying to showcase them here! Please add yours in a pull request!

When making a chapter logo, please use the official R-Ladies purple (`#88398a`) and include "R-Ladies" somewhere in the logo.

More info on branding can be found in the [starter-kit](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/tree/master/logo).
